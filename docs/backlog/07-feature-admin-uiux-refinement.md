# User Story: Refine Admin Dashboard UI/UX

**ID:** 07
**Type:** Feature (Admin)
**Estimate:** 1 SP

**As a** UI/UX Designer,
**I want** to review and potentially refine the layout, styling, and data presentation of the Admin Dashboard,
**So that** it is clear, usable, and visually consistent with the application's design guide.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The layout of the Admin Dashboard (`AdminPage.tsx`) is reviewed for clarity and information hierarchy.
*   Data presentation (KPIs, tables, lists) is reviewed for readability and ease of understanding.
*   Styling is checked for consistency with the `docs/design-style-guide.md` and the overall application theme.
*   Any identified areas for improvement (e.g., spacing, typography, component usage, responsiveness) are addressed through code changes.
*   The dashboard remains functional and displays data correctly after refinements.

**Notes:**

*   This story focuses on polishing the existing Admin Dashboard implementation.
*   May involve collaboration between UI/UX and Code modes.
