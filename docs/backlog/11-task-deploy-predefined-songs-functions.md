# User Story: Deploy Predefined Songs Cloud Functions

**ID:** 11
**Type:** Task (Deployment)
**Estimate:** 1 SP

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to deploy the Cloud Functions containing the finalized Predefined Songs feature logic,
**So that** the feature is live and available for use in the target environment.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The Cloud Functions related to the Predefined Songs feature (including modifications to `populateChallenges`, `submitSongNominationService`, and any new helper functions/handlers) are identified.
*   Any outstanding TypeScript errors or build issues related to these functions (as noted in `activeContext.md` [2025-04-13 16:08:52]) are resolved.
*   The command `firebase deploy --only functions` (or equivalent for the target environment) is executed successfully.
*   Deployment logs confirm the successful update of the relevant Cloud Functions.

**Notes:**

*   This task addresses the deployment failure noted in `activeContext.md`.
*   Prerequisite for Story #12 (Triggering `populateChallenges`).
