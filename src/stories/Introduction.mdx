<Title>Welcome to the Songer Storybook!</Title>

This Storybook serves as the central hub for the UI components used in the Songer application. It showcases our unique "Creative Handwritten" design style.

**Purpose:**

*   **Visualize Components:** See all available UI components in isolation.
*   **Interactive Playground:** Experiment with component props and states using Storybook Controls.
*   **Documentation:** Understand component usage, design guidelines, and accessibility considerations.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure a cohesive user experience across the application.

**Design System:**

Our design system is built upon:

*   **Base:** `shadcn/ui` components.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with a custom "Creative Handwritten" theme (using the "Patrick Hand" font, distinct borders/shadows, and playful rotations).
*   **Implementation:** Wrapper components (e.g., `CreativeButton`) apply the custom style over base components.

**Key Sections:**

*   **Design Tokens:** Explore the core visual elements like colors, typography, and icons.
*   **Components:** Browse through the library of available UI components, grouped by functionality.

**Maintainers:**
