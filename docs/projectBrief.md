1. Round Structure

Each round follows these steps:

Challenge Announcement:

The Round Host announces the musical challenge to all players.

Example Challenges:

"Most Danceable Song"

"Best Road Trip Anthem"

"Ultimate Party Starter"

"Song That Makes You Feel Empowered"

Song Selection:

a. Game-Provided Songs:

The Round Host presents a number of songs equal to the number of players.

These songs are selected from the game’s prepared list to match the challenge.

  - Presentation:

Display song titles and album covers, without revealing the artist names if desired.

b. Player-Contributed Songs:

Each player chooses one song they believe best fits the challenge.

  - Rules for Selection:

Songs must be available on the chosen music streaming service.

Songs should be appropriate for all audiences.

Player can also add a own song by searching for it on the music streaming service.

Players have a set time (e.g., 2 minutes) to decide on their song.

  3. Music Playback:

All selected songs are played for the group.

  - Order of Playback:

Shuffle the playback order to avoid bias.

Alternatively, play game-provided songs first, followed by player-contributed songs.

  - Playback Duration:

Play a 30-second snippet of each song, focusing on the chorus or a representative section.

  4. Discussion and Reactions:

Players can briefly discuss their thoughts on each song.

Encourage positive and fun interactions.

  5. Ranking/Voting:

Each player ranks the songs (excluding their own contributed song) based on how well they fit the challenge.

  - Ranking System:

Assign points in descending order (e.g., 1st choice = highest points).

Players submit their rankings privately to the Round Host.

  6. Scoring:

Points Allocation:

For each ranking, songs receive points corresponding to their position.

Example with 4 players (excluding own song):

1st Place: 3 points

2nd Place: 2 points

3rd Place: 1 point

  - Bonus Points:

If a player’s contributed song ranks in the top positions based on cumulative points, they earn bonus points.

  - Bonus Structure:

1st Place Contributed Song: +2 points

2nd Place Contributed Song: +1 point

  - Joker Usage:

If a player played their Joker this round, their total points (including bonuses) are doubled.

  7. Score Update:

The Round Host updates the scoreboard with the new scores.

Provide a brief summary of standings.

  8. Role Rotation:

The role of Round Host passes to the next player for the following round.

Rotation continues until all players have hosted a round or the predetermined number of rounds is reached.

2. Detailed Mechanics
A. Challenge Selection

The Round Host selects a challenge from the prepared list or creates one that aligns with the group's interests.

Challenges should be clear, creative, and open to interpretation.

B. Game-Provided Songs Selection

Songs should be diverse and well-known to accommodate varying musical tastes.

The Round Host ensures the songs align with the challenge and are appropriate.

C. Player-Contributed Songs Guidelines

D. Joker Mechanism

Each player has one Joker to use during the game.

  - Usage Rules:

The Joker must be played before the challenge is announced.

Players signal their Joker play by handing their Joker token to the Round Host.

A player can only use their Joker once per game.

  - Strategic Considerations:

Using the Joker early can give an early lead.

Saving it for later rounds may be beneficial if a player is behind.

E. Scoring Details

Ranking Points:

Points are awarded based on cumulative rankings from all players.

Players cannot rank their own contributed song.

  - Tie-Breakers:

In case of a tie in points, the song with the most first-place rankings wins.

If still tied, the Round Host may decide on a quick tie-breaker, such as a trivia question related to the songs.

Game End and Winning

General Guidelines

Consistency: Adhere strictly to the guidelines outlined in this document to maintain consistency.

Clean Code: Write clear, concise, and readable code. Avoid unnecessary complexity.

DRY Principle: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Reuse code where applicable to reduce redundancy.

KISS Principle: Keep It Simple, Stupid. Aim for simplicity in design and implementation.

YAGNI Principle: You Aren’t Gonna Need It. Only implement features that are necessary.

Code Formatting

Consistent code formatting enhances readability and maintainability.

Indentation: Use 2 spaces for indentation. Avoid using tabs.

Line Length: Limit lines to 100 characters. Wrap lines that exceed this limit.

Semicolons: Use semicolons at the end of statements.

Quotes: Use single quotes (') for strings unless double quotes (") are necessary.

Trailing Commas: Use trailing commas in multi-line arrays and objects.

Spacing:

Use a single space after keywords (if, for, switch, etc.) and before the opening parenthesis.

Use spaces around operators (=, +, -, ===, etc.).

Do not add spaces inside parentheses, brackets, or braces.

Example:

// Correct
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b;
};

// Incorrect
const add = (a: number, b: number): number => {
  return a + b;
};

export const createGame = async (data: any, context: any) => {
  try {
    const gameRef = firestore.collection('games').doc();
    await gameRef.set({
      hostTeamId: data.hostTeamId,
      currentRound: 1,
      totalRounds: data.totalRounds,
      status: 'active',
      teams: data.teams,
    });
    return { gameId: gameRef.id };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error creating game:', error);
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('internal', 'Unable to create game');
  }
};

Firestore Interactions

Atomic Operations: Use transactions and batch writes to ensure data integrity.

Security: Validate all data before writing to Firestore.

Example:

const assignPlayerToTeam = async (playerId: string, teamId: string) => {
  const gameRef = firestore.collection('games').doc(gameId);
  const teamRef = firestore.collection('teams').doc(teamId);
  const playerRef = firestore.collection('players').doc(playerId);

  await firestore.runTransaction(async (transaction) => {
    const teamDoc = await transaction.get(teamRef);
    if (!teamDoc.exists) {
      throw new Error('Team does not exist');
    }

    transaction.update(playerRef, { teamId });
    transaction.update(teamRef, {
      members: firestore.FieldValue.arrayUnion(playerId),
    });
  });
};

Error Handling

Consistent Responses: Ensure all functions return consistent error messages.

Logging: Log errors for debugging purposes without exposing sensitive information.

Styling with Tailwind CSS and shadcn

Utility-First: Embrace Tailwind’s utility-first approach for rapid styling.

Custom Classes: Use @apply for creating reusable custom classes in CSS files when necessary.

Component Libraries: Leverage shadcn components for consistency and accessibility.

Responsive Design: Utilize Tailwind’s responsive design utilities to ensure compatibility across devices.

Example:

// src/components/Button/Button.tsx
import React from 'react';

interface ButtonProps {
  onClick: () => void;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ onClick, children }) => (
  <button onClick={onClick} className='bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded'>
    {children}
  </button>
);

export default Button;

Function Documentation: Document functions with JSDoc annotations.

README Files: Maintain up-to-date README files for each major directory or component.

Example:

/**
 * Calculates the total score based on player rankings.
 * @param rankings - Array of player rankings.
 * @returns Total score.
 */
const calculateTotalScore = (rankings: number[]): number => {
  return rankings.reduce((total, rank) => total + rank, 0);
};

Testing

Unit Tests: Write unit tests for all functions and components using Vitest.

Integration Tests: Ensure different parts of the application work together as expected.

End-to-End Tests: Use Cypress to simulate user interactions and validate workflows.

Coverage: Aim for at least 80% code coverage.

Example:

// tests/unit/calculateTotalScore.test.ts
import { calculateTotalScore } from '../../src/utils/helpers';

describe('calculateTotalScore', () => {
  it('should return the correct total score', () => {
    const rankings = [1, 2, 3];
    const total = calculateTotalScore(rankings);
    expect(total).toBe(6);
  });

  it('should return 0 for an empty array', () => {
    const rankings: number[] = [];
    const total = calculateTotalScore(rankings);
    expect(total).toBe(0);
  });
});

Best Practices

Avoid Magic Numbers: Use named constants instead of hard-coded numbers.

Immutable Data: Favor immutability to prevent unintended side effects.

Avoid Deep Nesting: Keep code flat and avoid excessive nesting for better readability.

Optimize Imports: Import only necessary modules to keep bundle sizes small.

Use ESLint and Prettier: Integrate ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting to enforce standards automatically.

Example ESLint Configuration:

{
  "extends": ["eslint:recommended", "plugin:react/recommended", "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended", "prettier"],
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "react"],
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "env": {
    "browser": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "settings": {
    "react": {
      "version": "detect"
    }
  },
  "rules": {
    // Custom rules
  }
