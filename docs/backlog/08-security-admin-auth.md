# User Story: Secure Admin Dashboard Access

**ID:** 08
**Type:** Security (Admin)
**Estimate:** 1 SP

**As an** Administrator,
**I want** the Admin Dashboard route (`/admin`) and its associated data-fetching Cloud Functions (`getAdminDashboardData`, `getAdminChallengeData`) to be protected by authentication and authorization,
**So that** only authorized personnel can access potentially sensitive game data and administrative functions.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   An authentication mechanism is implemented for accessing the `/admin` route (e.g., requiring a specific Firebase user role, checking against a list of admin UIDs, or using Firebase App Check).
*   Frontend routing logic prevents unauthorized users from accessing the `/admin` page.
*   The `getAdminDashboardData` and `getAdminChallengeData` Cloud Functions include authorization checks (e.g., verifying `request.auth.token.admin === true` or checking UID against an admin list) before returning data.
*   Unauthorized attempts to access the route or call the functions are appropriately handled (e.g., redirect, error message, function throwing `permission-denied` error).
*   Authorized administrators can successfully access the dashboard and view the data.

**Notes:**

*   Addresses the security note mentioned in the Admin Dashboard decision log entry (`decisionLog.md` [2025-04-13 16:41:00]).
*   Depends on the implementation of a general authentication system (Story #2) or requires a specific admin authentication strategy.
