# User Story: Cleanup Predefined Songs Development Artifacts

**ID:** 13
**Type:** Task (Cleanup)
**Estimate:** 1 SP

**As a** Developer,
**I want** to remove the unused `scripts/populate-challenge-songs.ts` script and revert related temporary tsconfig changes,
**So that** the codebase remains clean, organized, and free of obsolete development artifacts.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

*   The file `scripts/populate-challenge-songs.ts` is deleted from the repository.
*   Any temporary modifications made to `tsconfig.node.json` or other configuration files specifically to support the execution of this script are reverted.
*   The project builds and runs correctly after the cleanup.

**Notes:**

*   Assumes the functionality of the script is now handled by the `populateChallenges` Cloud Function (as per Story #19 or previous implementation).
*   Part of the cleanup tasks mentioned in `progress.md` [2025-04-13 09:57:11].
